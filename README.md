# commit-watcher-rules

[Commit Watcher](https://github.com/srcclr/commit-watcher) finds interesting and potentially hazardous commits in git projects. Watch your own projects to make sure you didn't accidentally leak your AWS keys or other credentials, and watch open-source projects you use to find undisclosed security vulnerabilities and patches.

The **commit-watcher-rules** project contains a collection of [rules](https://github.com/srcclr/commit-watcher/blob/master/config/rule_types.yml) you can use with Commit Watcher. 

Any submissions made to the community rules will be Apache 2.0 licensed.
